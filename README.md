# hypermail-mcp

A **Model Context Protocol** server that lets an agent operate any of the user's
inboxes through a single, unified tool surface.

> **v0.7.14** — Added opt-in `HYPERMAIL_DEBUG` structured stderr logs with
> redaction for server startup, account-store locking/checkpoint writes, and
> `get_new_emails` candidate/claim flow. Hardened Outlook `edit_draft` body
> updates by requesting Graph's updated representation, re-reading with retries,
> and returning an error instead of `edited: true` if the requested body change
> is not observable; Outlook body edits also get one safe replay after attachment
> handling when the final read is stale.
>
> **v0.7.13** — Hardened `get_new_emails` against duplicate delivery when
> multiple MCP processes share the same encrypted account store. Store writes
> now reload and merge under a cross-process lock, checkpoints are monotonic,
> and new-email batches are atomically claimed before being returned. `trash_email`
> also now uses provider-native trash operations for Gmail and IMAP trash aliases.
>
> **v0.7.12** — Hardened Outlook reply/forward draft formatting when
> Microsoft Graph labels generated thread history as HTML but returns
> plain/unstructured text. Such histories are now defensively normalized with
> escaped content and line breaks so quoted messages remain readable.
>
> **v0.7.11** — Fixed Outlook reply/forward drafts whose Graph-generated
> quoted bodies are plain text by escaping them and patching the draft as HTML,
> so newly composed HTML replies no longer render as raw text.
>
> **v0.7.10** — Fixed an account-store race where Gmail/Outlook token
> refreshes could overwrite `get_new_emails` checkpoints. Checkpoint updates now
> preserve token data and merge delivered IDs at the same timestamp. `edit_draft`
> body edits now require exact selected-section replacement (`old_text` +
> `new_text`) so reply/forward history is preserved instead of overwritten.
>
> **v0.7.9** — Replaced server-side email watch/webhook/script delivery with
> the pull-based `get_new_emails` tool. Agents schedule their own repeated calls
> and fetch bounded batches of new inbox email.
>
> **v0.7.8** — Default Gmail loopback redirect URI changed from random-port
> `/oauth2callback` to fixed `http://127.0.0.1:33333/callback` (still overridable via
> `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI`). `.data/` encryption key directory added to
> `.gitignore`.
>
> **v0.7.7** — Env-only configuration. Runtime config now comes from flat
> `HYPERMAIL_*` environment variables plus selected CLI overrides. Config files
> and legacy provider env names are no longer read. Hosted Gmail OAuth callbacks
> are supported via `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI`; local loopback and manual
> completion still work.
>
> **v0.7.6** — Gmail setup uses OAuth authorization URLs instead of Google's
> rejected device-code flow for Gmail API scopes. `complete_add_account` accepts
> a final redirected URL or raw `code`/`state`, and provider credentials use
> dedicated `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_*` / `HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_*` env vars.
>
> **v0.7.5** — Attachments via file path on `send_email`/`draft_email`
> (`attachments` param). `edit_draft` gains `new_attachments` and
> `remove_attachments` — `add_attachment_to_draft` is removed (23 tools now).
> Draft editing uses multi-strategy thread boundary detection for more reliable
> quoted-thread preservation. Published CLI installs the MCP SDK dependency so
> global/npx runs do not fail on a missing SDK module.
>
> **v0.7.4** — `inReplyTo` is now a required parameter on `send_email` and
> `draft_email` (was optional). Set it to `false` for a new email, or pass a
> message ID to thread a reply. This forces the agent to make an explicit choice
> instead of silently treating replies as new conversations.
>
> **v0.7.3** — `edit_draft` now preserves the quoted thread history when editing
> Outlook reply/forward drafts. Previously, editing a draft body would overwrite
> the entire content — including the quoted thread. Now only the answer part
> (above the spacer delimiter) is replaced.
>
> **v0.7.1** — Every config field is now settable via a dedicated
> `HYPERMAIL_*` env var. Legacy provider env vars are no longer accepted. See
> [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the full reference.

> **v0.6.3** — Unify stdio and HTTP modes into a single feature set. Removed
> email watch (inbox polling, SSE push, notification buffer), agent
> multi-tenancy (`agents.yaml`, `x-api-key` auth, per-agent allowlists), and
> the `check_notifications` tool. Dropped `js-yaml` dependency. Dockerfile
> simplified to a single `install → build → prune` step.
>
> **v0.6.2** — Version source-of-truth fix: `version.ts` now imports directly
> from `package.json` instead of hardcoding, preventing version drift between
> the two files.
>
> **v0.6.1** — Docker deployment (standalone Dockerfile with HEALTHCHECK),
> email notification bug fixes (ID-based dedup, pagination cap, dynamic
> re-scan), Node 22 base image, dropped docker-compose.
>
> **v0.5.0** — Replaced optional `isHtml` boolean with required `format`
> parameter (`"html"` | `"markdown"`) on `send_email`, `draft_email`, and
> `edit_draft`. Markdown bodies are converted to HTML via `marked` so
> recipients always see clean HTML.
>
> **v0.4.3** — Upgraded Zod to v4.4.3. Fixed MCP SDK v1.29.0 compatibility
> by wrapping all tool schemas in `z.object()` and replacing discriminated
> union output schemas that caused `validateToolOutput` crashes.

The agent doesn't care whether an address is a work Outlook account, a personal
Microsoft account, a personal IMAP mailbox, or Gmail — it just calls
`list_emails`, `search_emails`, `read_email`, `send_email` and passes the email
address as the `account` argument. The server routes to the right backend.

**v1 status:** Outlook / Microsoft 365 (personal + work) fully supported via
Microsoft Graph. IMAP (any IMAP server) supported via `imapflow` + `nodemailer`.
Gmail supported via Google OAuth authorization-code flow with local loopback or
hosted callbacks plus remote-safe manual completion.

## Why

- Existing Outlook/M365 MCP servers (e.g. `@softeria/ms-365-mcp-server`) expose
  ~200 raw Graph endpoints and are tied to a single signed-in user.
- This project wraps the same proven stack (`@azure/msal-node` for auth,
  `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` for HTTP) but exposes only a small,
  provider-agnostic email API and supports **multiple accounts at once**, keyed
  by email address.

## Install / run

```bash
npm install -g hypermail-mcp     # or pnpm / npx
hypermail-mcp --help
```

Run as a stdio MCP server (the default) — wire it into your MCP host:

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hyper-email": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "hypermail-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or via the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add hypermail -- npx -y hypermail-mcp
```

### As a hosted HTTP server

```bash
hypermail-mcp --http --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0
# endpoint: http://<host>:3000/mcp  (Streamable HTTP transport, session-aware)
```

When hosted, set `HYPERMAIL_KEY` so the account file is reproducibly
decryptable across restarts and redeploys.

### Docker

```bash
# Build
docker build -t hypermail-mcp .

# Run
# Pass secret values from your shell or deployment environment; do not commit them.
docker run -d \
  --name hypermail-mcp \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e HYPERMAIL_KEY \
  -e HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID \
  -e HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID \
  -v hypermail-data:/var/lib/mcp \
  hypermail-mcp
```

The image runs the server in HTTP mode on port 3000 with a 30-second
HEALTHCHECK against `/mcp`. Data is persisted via a Docker volume at
`/var/lib/mcp`.

### Development

To test the HTTP server locally:

```bash
# Terminal 1: auto-rebuild TypeScript on save
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: start HTTP server with env/CLI config
pnpm dev:http
```

The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp`.

## Runtime and provider configuration

Hypermail uses flat `HYPERMAIL_*` environment variables as the source of truth.
There is no runtime config file. CLI flags only override transport, host, port,
and data directory for a single invocation.

CLI flags: `--http`, `--port`, `--host`, `--data-dir`, `--help`.

Subcommands: `hypermail-mcp generate-key` — generate a base64 32-byte key for
`HYPERMAIL_KEY`.

### Local CLI / env example

```bash
export HYPERMAIL_KEY="$(hypermail-mcp generate-key)"
export HYPERMAIL_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/hypermail-mcp"
export HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID="<your-client-id>"
hypermail-mcp
```

### Generic MCP client JSON example

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hypermail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "hypermail-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HYPERMAIL_KEY": "${HYPERMAIL_KEY}",
        "HYPERMAIL_DATA_DIR": "${HYPERMAIL_DATA_DIR}",
        "HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID": "${HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Env var | Purpose | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HYPERMAIL_DATA_DIR` | Account/token store location | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/hypermail-mcp` |
| `HYPERMAIL_KEY` | 32-byte AES-256-GCM key as hex/base64, or any passphrase derived via SHA-256 | If unset, generates and persists a local key and prints a startup warning |
| `HYPERMAIL_TRANSPORT` | Runtime transport: `stdio` or `http` | `stdio`; `--http` overrides to `http` |
| `HYPERMAIL_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP bind port | `3000`; invalid HTTP-mode values warn and fall back |
| `HYPERMAIL_HTTP_HOST` | HTTP bind host | `127.0.0.1`; invalid HTTP-mode values warn and fall back |
| `HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID` | Optional custom Azure/Entra public client ID | Built-in public client |
| `HYPERMAIL_OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID` | Optional Outlook tenant/authority selector | `common` |
| `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID | Required when adding a Gmail account |
| `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret, when issued by the client type | unset |
| `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI` | Hosted Gmail OAuth callback URI | Local loopback callback when unset |
| `HYPERMAIL_TOOLS_ENABLED` | Comma-separated tool allowlist | Empty/unset means no filtering |
| `HYPERMAIL_TOOLS_DISABLED` | Comma-separated tool blocklist | Empty/unset means no filtering |
| `HYPERMAIL_DEBUG` | Enable structured debug logs to stderr (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`, or `debug`) | Disabled by default |

**Priority order:** selected CLI flags > `HYPERMAIL_*` env vars > hardcoded defaults.

Per-tool filtering (`HYPERMAIL_TOOLS_ENABLED` / `HYPERMAIL_TOOLS_DISABLED`) lets
operators ship minimal agent-facing surfaces. If both non-empty lists are set,
or either list contains an unknown tool name, startup fails.

## Tools

All "email" tools take an `account` argument — the email address of the inbox
to operate on. The server resolves the right provider from the encrypted
account store.

| Tool | Inputs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_accounts` | — | Returns registered emails + provider, no secrets. |
| `add_account` | `provider`, `email?`, `config?` | Starts the provider add flow. Outlook returns a device code; Gmail returns an OAuth URL. Returns `{handle, verification:{type, userCode, verificationUri, expiresAt, message}}`. |
| `complete_add_account` | `provider`, `handle`, `authorizationResponse?`, `code?`, `state?` | Returns `pending` / `ready` / `expired` / `error`. Gmail accepts a pasted final redirected URL or raw code/state for remote-safe completion. |
| `get_account_settings` | `account` | Get signature (HTML) and style preferences for an account. |
| `set_account_settings` | `account`, `signature?`, `signaturePath?`, `style?` | Set signature HTML (inline or via file path) and font preferences. |
| `remove_account` | `email` | Deletes tokens for the account. |
| `list_emails` | `account`, `folder?`, `limit?`, `unreadOnly?`, `skip?` | Defaults: folder=`inbox`, limit=25. Supports pagination via `skip` — response includes `hasMore`. |
| `get_new_emails` | `account?`, `limit?` | Pull new inbox emails not previously returned by this tool. `limit` defaults to 10 and is global when `account` is omitted. Returns full markdown bodies with attachment metadata; bodies may be truncated. |
| `search_emails` | `account`, `query`, `limit?` | KQL on Outlook. |
| `read_email` | `account`, `id`, `format?` | Returns full body + recipients + attachment metadata. `format`: `markdown` (default), `html`, or `text`. |
| `read_attachment` | `account`, `messageId`, `attachmentId` | Download an attachment to a temporary file and return its path. |
| `archive_email` | `account`, `id` | Move a message to the Archive folder. |
| `trash_email` | `account`, `id` | Move a message to Deleted Items (trash). |
| `move_email` | `account`, `id`, `destination` | Move to any folder by well-known name (`inbox`, `drafts`, etc.) or custom folder ID. |
| `send_email` | `account`, `to[]`, `cc?`, `bcc?`, `subject`, `body`, `format`, `include_signature`, `inReplyTo`, `replyAll?`, `forwardMessageId?`, `attachments?` | Send an email. `format` (`"html"` or `"markdown"`) controls body format — Markdown is converted to HTML via `marked`. Appends signature when `include_signature` is true. `inReplyTo` sends as threaded reply; `forwardMessageId` sends as forward. `inReplyTo` is required — set to `false` for new emails. `attachments` is an optional array of `{filePath, name?}` — files are read from disk and encoded automatically. |
| `draft_email` | `account`, `to[]`, `cc?`, `bcc?`, `subject`, `body`, `format`, `include_signature`, `inReplyTo`, `replyAll?`, `forwardMessageId?`, `attachments?` | Save as draft instead of sending. Same params as `send_email` including `attachments`. Returns the draft message ID and HTML body (`draftHtml`). `inReplyTo` is required — set to `false` for new emails. |
| `edit_draft` | `account`, `id`, `to?`, `cc?`, `bcc?`, `subject?`, `old_text?`, `new_text?`, `body?`, `format?`, `include_signature?`, `new_attachments?`, `remove_attachments?` | Edit an existing draft by ID. Body edits require exact selected-section replacement: copy `old_text` from the current draft HTML (`draftHtml` or `read_email` with `format: "html"`) and provide `new_text`; the match must occur exactly once, and unselected content such as reply/forward history is preserved. Deprecated `body` is only an alias for `new_text` when `old_text` is also provided; body-only full replacement is rejected. Body edits are re-read after saving; if the updated body is not observable after retries, the tool returns an error instead of reporting success. `new_attachments` adds files (`{filePath, name?}[]`); `remove_attachments` removes by attachment ID (`string[]`). Returns the updated draft ID, HTML body (`draftHtml`), and attachment metadata. |
| `send_draft` | `account`, `id` | Send an existing draft email by ID. Use with draft IDs returned by `draft_email` or `edit_draft`. |
| `list_folders` | `account`, `parentFolderId?` | List available mail folders. Returns top-level folders by default, or children of `parentFolderId`. |
| `create_folder` | `account`, `displayName`, `parentFolderId?` | Create a new mail folder under root (default) or the given parent. |
| `delete_folder` | `account`, `folderId` | Delete a mail folder by ID. |
| `rename_folder` | `account`, `folderId`, `newName` | Rename an existing mail folder. |
| `mark_read` | `account`, `id` | Mark a message as read. |
| `mark_unread` | `account`, `id` | Mark a message as unread. |

## Pull new emails

`get_new_emails` is the replacement for server-side watch/push delivery. The
server does not run background cron jobs; agents or their harnesses call this
tool on their own schedule, for example every 30–60 seconds.

**Behavior:**
- Polls **inbox only**.
- `account` is optional. When omitted, the tool checks all registered accounts.
- `limit` defaults to `10`. In all-account mode, the limit is a global total
  across accounts, selected by oldest `receivedAt` first.
- First use for an account initializes its checkpoint to the newest inbox email
  and returns no emails for that account.
- Later calls return emails not previously returned by this tool, oldest first.
- Returned bodies are markdown and may be truncated around 20k characters; call
  `read_email` for the full body when needed.
- Attachments are returned as metadata only; call `read_attachment` for content.
- The tool does not mark emails as read.
- `limit: 0` can initialize/check state without fetching message bodies.

All-account calls return partial failures as `errors: [{ account, message }]`
and still return successful accounts' emails.

See [`examples/hermes/`](examples/hermes/) for a Hermes scheduler integration
that polls this tool and hands new-email payloads to a Hermes agent.

## Add-account flows

### Outlook

1. Agent calls `add_account({ provider: "outlook" })`.
2. Server returns:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "pending",
     "handle": "…uuid…",
     "verification": {
       "type": "device_code",
       "userCode": "ABCD-EFGH",
       "verificationUri": "https://microsoft.com/devicelogin",
       "expiresAt": "2025-…",
       "message": "To sign in, use a web browser to open …"
     }
   }
   ```
3. The user opens the URL and enters the code.
4. Agent polls `complete_add_account({ provider: "outlook", handle })` until
   it returns `{ "status": "ready", "account": {...} }`.
5. From then on, any tool can be called with `account: "<that-email>"`.

### Gmail

Gmail uses Google OAuth 2.0, matching the official Gmail MCP model. Google's
device-code endpoint rejects Gmail API scopes, so Hypermail uses an authorization
URL with a real callback. Service accounts are only suitable for Google
Workspace domain-wide delegation; they don't grant server-to-server access to
consumer `@gmail.com` inboxes.

For local stdio/Desktop OAuth clients, Hypermail starts a temporary
`127.0.0.1` loopback callback server automatically. For hosted HTTP deployments,
set `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI` and register the exact URI in Google Auth
Platform, for example:

```bash
HYPERMAIL_TRANSPORT=http
HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=https://mail.example.com/oauth/gmail/callback
```

1. Configure `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` and, when issued by your Google client
   type, `HYPERMAIL_GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`. Use a Desktop client for local
   loopback, or a Web client for hosted HTTP callbacks.
2. Agent calls `add_account({ provider: "gmail" })`.
3. Server returns an OAuth URL:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "pending",
     "handle": "…uuid…",
     "verification": {
       "type": "oauth_url",
       "userCode": "",
       "verificationUri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?...",
       "expiresAt": "2025-…",
       "message": "Open this URL in a browser to authorize Gmail access..."
     }
   }
   ```
4. The user opens `verificationUri` and grants access. If the configured
   callback is reachable, the browser shows a small success page and the agent
   can poll `complete_add_account({ provider: "gmail", handle })` until ready.
5. If the browser cannot reach the callback, the manual fallback still works:
   copy the final redirected URL from the browser address bar and call:
   ```json
   {
     "provider": "gmail",
     "handle": "…uuid…",
     "authorizationResponse": "http://127.0.0.1:54321/oauth2callback?code=...&state=..."
   }
   ```
6. `complete_add_account` validates state, exchanges the code for tokens, stores
   the account, and returns `{ "status": "ready", "account": {...} }`.
